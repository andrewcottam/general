Steve suggestions:
1. Follow up on MapHub - can web map some more protected areas - OSM
Leo and CHris at maphubshubs
If we want to map Protected Areas in OSM how do we do this?
2. Get access to ArcGIS hosted at JRC
3. Presentation of Marxan Web to the team



Sens email to Jen for Vizzuality to be able to understand Marxan Web
make a clone of mats marxan github repo


Topics for discussion with Tom:
- Notice period
- Confirm Education Allowance in Terms
- Can I still be on the steering group for GBIF BID?
- Proposals from Google on Monitoring
  - What about Kaggle? StreetView etc.
