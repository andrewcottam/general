Dear ,

I would like to apply for the Lead Data Scientist position at the Crowther Lab advertised on xx/xx/xxx. This brief cover letter outlines my background and skills and sets our why I am particularly excited about this job.

I am a conservation data scientist with over 20 years experience working with governments, NGOs, research institutions and the private sector in applying geospatial technologies to help in the fight against biodiversity loss and climate change.

The position at ETH appeals to me for many reasons, but my main motivation is that the position matches my expertise so well that I am sure I would be able to contribute significantly to the development of the Lab as it grows.

This is an excellent opportunity to demonstrate my ability in using geospatial and big-data technologies in the climate change and conservation sectors.

My technical skills encompass a broad range of information technologies from big-data and cloud computing (such as Google Earth Engine) to relational databases, machine learning, web mapping applications, GIS analyses and data mining. I am an advanced user of Google Earth Engine and of GIS tools (both open source and proprietary).

I have been published in a number of Journals including Nature where we published a global dataset of surface water over the last 32 years. My role was in the method development and in all the software engineering on Google Earth Engine and all of the custom web mapping tools that were used to deliver such a high quality product.
