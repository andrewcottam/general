### Aims of project monitoring
- To learn lessons
- To inform actions (i.e. adaptive management)
Providing ecological insights
- To monitor progress against forest restoration goals
	- Societal benefits, e.g. ecosystems services like carbon storage, watershed protection (e.g. you can measure turbidity)
	- Ecosystem restoration
	- Distinction between natural regeneration and regrowth enhanced by restoration efforts
- Inform policy
- Compliance monitoring
- Outcome monitoring, e.g. common standards monitoring
- Straight ecological research that is valuable to the wider scientific community, e.g. like the Rothamsted Light Trap
 - so that you can build ecological models and predict changes in the future, e.g. through climate change
- To compare natural regeneration processes to assisted regeneration

Neither of these will be achieved using satellite imagery! The method must be **robust** and **sensitive**.

e.g. If all the seedlings die and other seeds in the seed bank grow you are measuring plant growth where your restoration has failed

e.g. In Pine Wood Nematode study measuring condition requires 20cm resolution to see unhealthy pine trees

**The phenomenon you are trying to measure is at a smaller scale than the imagery**

### What you can use satellite imagery for
#### Identifying medium to long term trends
For example, phenology, vegetation indices, canopy heights. These can be used to develop alert systems.

EXAMPLE: APAAT - alert system based on NDVI

#### Observing dynamic processes
For example, succession, gap dynamics, disturbance history

### Ideal approach
- Multiscale
	- In-situ for early restoration
	- Airborne/drone for 5+ years
	- Satellite for 10+ years

#### In-situ
TrekkerView from Google
Phone apps
Citizen Science
	- Good will could be waning
Wireless sensor networks - Measure temperature, humidity, wind etc across restoration sites at different heights etc.
AA batteries last up to a year or solar (needs 3hr per day)
 - In a mesh with ad-hoc networks - VERY LOW COST
What gets deployed where will vary depending on the requirements

- Need a network of pilot sites to do the following:
 - Generate sample data/training data for ML algorithms
 - Act as calibration sites for sensors
 - Act as validation sites where we know what the land cover classes/parameters we are measuring
 - Act as test sites for ML competitions, e.g. Kaggle

#### Airborne/drone
Best example is Greg Asners Global Airborne Observatory combining LIDAR, hyperspectral.

##### Issues
- Need a good DEM to do proper orthorectification

#### Satellite
##### Platforms
###### GEDI - Ecosystem LIDAR (Global Ecosystems Dynamics Investigation)
###### DigitalGlobe (MAXAR) WorldView 3
Has 8 bands:
31cm pancromatic
1.24m multispectral
3.7m SWIR
30m CAVIS (Clouds, Aerosols, Vapors, Ice, and Snow)
<1 day revisit
$20/Km2 for archived, $30 for tasking from landinfo.com
But 1.30pm - so no shadows to be able to detect individual crowns

##### Planet PlanetScope
##### Planet SkySat
50cm Blue, Green, Red, Near Infrared, and Panchromatic

##### Issues
- Resolution - can use linear spectral unmixing but number of endmembers must be < no of bands
- Cloudy imagery
- Won't get beneath the canopy
- Wobble means you can't get trends for the same trees
- Mission continuity

### Reference layers
#### Land tenure
#### DEM
#### Water catchments

### Key Performance indicators
#### Get some parameters from hindcasting before the forest was degraded or logged
So we can set these as targets to achieve, e.g. NDVI or species richness etc.
Could use adjacent unlogged areas but there will be many variables different e.g. slope, aspect, topography which will affect e.g. height
There could be lots of KPIs that measure progress against full restoration, e.g. structural restoration, Biodiversity restoration, soil restoration etc.

### Specific indicators
This will be different for different locations, aims etc.
#### Canopy structure
- GEDI to get height, 3d vegetation structure and biomass
- Height: Nico Lang from ETH: Country-wide high-resolution vegetation height mapping with Sentinel-2
https://medium.com/ecovisioneth/mapping-forest-structures-with-deep-learning-c1d3c1b41e4e

#### Crown detection
- Allows you to measure growth, count trees, estimate carbon and exclude understory vegetation or soils
- Evaluation of alternative methods. There are lots. Heres one from a tree detection special issue in RS:
https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/12/3/585/htm
Region growing may not be the best for tropical forests/complex canopies.
Different crown detection methods for different sites, ages etc!!!

Asner paper on detecting species in tropical forests:
https://europepmc.org/article/pmc/pmc4496029

- Use Hansen for identifying gaps in degraded forests and then do Tree Crown Delineation (TCD)

#### Canopy growth
- Ratios of various land covers over time, e.g. bare soil/vegetation, vegetation/canopies

#### Canopy Temperature
Can we collect mote data on temperature and see if it correlates with Landsat 7 thermal temperature? Do it when you do the Google Trekker transect!!! With a smartphone

#### Crown height
Point clouds
- Airborne Laser Scanner (mentioned in Serge Wichs paper https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303243418303660)
- Terrestrial Laser Scanner

Can we use imagery from 2 times of the day to get the crown height based on shadow length?
e.g. use Planet at 10am and WorldView at 1.30pm and look at the difference

#### Sound monitoring can also be used to capture species !!!
##### Issues
- Resolution of the imagery
- Method: region growing, segmentation, edge detection, deep learning etc.
- Accurate DEM and georeferencing is needed to track individual crowns

- From Pieters paper:

'the relatively coarse resolution of satellite compared to airborne
images hinders the precise spatial alignment of images acquired on different dates, which is
required to detect changes in individual tree crowns over time'

' To provide a detailed record of individual coniferous tree crowns in the buffer
zone, the area should be imaged in colour at 20 cm or higher spatial resolution from
manned airborne platforms.'

#### Condition
There are many band combinations that can be used to measure water stress, senescence, pigment changes etc.
The thermal band is particularly useful for detecting water stress - in Sentinel 2 there is no thermal band
Sentinel 3 has a thermal band but at 1Km - Landsat 8 is at 100m (TIRS) - L7 is 60m
ASTER - Japanese 90m


EXAMPLE: Site condition monitoring in the UK

#### Plant growth
##### NDVI
NIR and Red bands ratio
You can also use a the Visible Atmospherically Resistant Index which is visible bands only - see https://learn.arcgis.com/en/projects/use-deep-learning-to-assess-palm-tree-health/#estimate-vegetation-health

##### Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR)

#### Proxy measures of restoration
- Soil run off can be seen in rivers, e.g. ridge to reef

### Data management
#### Delivery
e.g. through ESRIs IoT
### WRI Methodology
- Always good to reuse
- There is a bit of smoke and mirrors with Global Forest Watch
- Is the offer in-kind contribution, an SLA, software etc.

- Focused at the national level at SDGs

#### Malawi
Links to lots of SDG areas and includes mostly field-collected data

#### Rwanda
CollectEarth - downloadable tool or online tool crowd-sourcing technology for doing field survey work
Field-collected data is potentially open to abuse
Imagery not necessarily up-to-date

#### Validation
Need to be able to validate farmers have planted trees - compliance monitoring

EXAMPLE: Copernicus Land Monitoring Services
Hot spot monitoring
Global Surface Water
We set strict thresholds for the accuracy which they must meet

### Ideas
Training using historic events:
- Have there already been restoration sites that we can train our satellite models on?
- What about areas that have been naturally degraded through fires, tornados, landslides etc. - natural regeneration
- Database of known past restoration projects - especially those that have failed -can we learn from these using imagery?

### My ideas for restoration projects
- Peat swamp forests of Sumatra and Kalimantan
- Rosewood forests of Senegal
- Mangrove forests of Vietnam after agent orange

### Actual restoration projects (from Simeon)
- ReforestTheTropics manage 2Km2 in Costa Rica
- PlantForThePlanet have 225Km2 in Mexico with 1million trees planted each year = 225*20 = $4500 for WorldView 3
- Fairventures worldwide 8km2 in borneo with 1million trees

### Restoration potential of planting trees

THINGS FOR TODAY:
- Site condition monitoring at JNCC: favourable, unfavourable or destroyed (for habitats)
- Detecting tree crowns
- GEDI
- Monitoring plant growth
- WRI method
- Check tools are working
- Reread comments from restoration people
- Nico Langs paper
- Pine wood nematode image Xylella fastidiosa what is it?
- ESRI remote sensing and machine learning https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jd_e39zhvbI

THE RESTOR FOUNDATION COULD OFFER A SERVICE FOR IDENTIFYING TREE CROWNS USING THEIR IMAGERY!

pipeline
- Capture how many seedlings planted etc
- Buy commercial imagery like WorldView
- Put into GEE or use ESRI Python API (Jupyter notebook), Javascript API etc.
- Evaluation of different methods of TCD
- Upload an image - it identifies the tree crowns, areas, species and the health (from NDVI)
- Do this over time to get temporal profiles of area and health etc.



Existing tools:
These require an enormous amount of input:
- Spatial Monitoring And Reporting Tool
- CollectEarth - CitizenScience app with image sequence through time
	- Big issue is that the imagery is free and undated!!!!
- Geowiki
- OpenStreetMap
- GalaxyZoo
- RSPB IBA Monitoring Tool


Questions for the funders:
- What are their guiding principles of Restor? Money or ecology?
-
